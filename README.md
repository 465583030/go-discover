# A concurrent local network discovery library.

Currently makes HTTP requests on ips within a specified range on port 80 and 443, looking
for webservers on a local network.

I'm rewriting it to include nmap-like scanning. Please stay tuned as
I have a lot going on, but this will be worked on often.
